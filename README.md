# ThreeDmal

(Read as *three-d-mal*, similar to *minimal*.)

Based on a fork from [WaveJS](https://github.com/PlainConcepts/WaveJS/commit/1d1f3e8fb5b1a8e5ab01bea719f22e0cd3a2364d).

A minimalist 3D engine for learning the mathematics involved:
- a Model is made of vertices and triangles
- a Scene is made of a Camera and a list of Model, drawing these last's triangles
- all in one single JavaScript file (< 500 lines of code)

A demo can be found [here](index.html).
